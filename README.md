      <summary><b> What I'm Working On </summary>
        I'm currently working on a fully in browser OS! I'm thinking of nameing it misteOS or something like that lol. It's gonna include games, browsers (proxies) and probably some chat system. I'm gonna try to make a bit of alts too because I ain't tryna get it blocked.
