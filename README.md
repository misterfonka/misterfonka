### echo("Hello World ðŸ‘‹")

Hello everyone!
My name is Liam, and I specilize in ChromeOS.
This probably makes sense because I am in school right now.
I mainly specilize in Shell, HTML, CSS, Python, and Javascript!

(Btw i'm still working on this GitHub account so i'm trying to make it be better.)
